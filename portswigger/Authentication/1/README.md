# Lab: Username enumeration via different responses

This lab is vulnerable to username enumeration and password brute-force attacks. It has an account with a predictable username and password, which can be found in the following wordlists:

> Candidate usernames

> Candidate passwords

To solve the lab, enumerate a valid username, brute-force this user's password, then access their account page.
