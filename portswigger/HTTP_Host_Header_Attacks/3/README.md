# Lab: Web cache poisoning via ambiguous requests

This lab is vulnerable to web cache poisoning due to discrepancies in how the cache and the back-end application handle ambiguous requests. An unsuspecting user regularly visits the site's home page.

To solve the lab, poison the cache so the home page executes alert(document.cookie) in the victim's browser.
